## Problem Statement

### Current State

The bigCode codebase suffers from significant constant duplication:

- **996+ occurrences** of provider string literals (`"codex"`, `"claudeAgent"`, `"copilot"`, `"opencode"`) across **106 files**
- **294 occurrences** of WebSocket method names across **10 files**
- Dozens of default values, configuration constants, and magic strings scattered throughout the codebase
- Inconsistent patterns: some constants defined inline, others in domain files, creating confusion

### Real-World Example

Looking at `apps/web/src/components/settings/useSettingsRestore.ts`:

```typescript
const PROVIDER_KEYS = ["codex", "claudeAgent", "copilot", "opencode"] as const;
```

This same array is defined in multiple places:

- `packages/contracts/src/orchestration.ts` (as Schema.Literals)
- `apps/server/src/serverSettings.ts` (as PROVIDER_ORDER)
- `apps/web/src/modelSelection.ts` (in object keys)
- And many more...

### Impact

1. **Maintenance Burden**: Adding a new provider requires updates in dozens of files
2. **Type Safety Risks**: String literals are prone to typos (e.g., `"claudAgent"` vs `"claudeAgent"`)
3. **Poor Discoverability**: Developers must search the entire codebase to find constant definitions
4. **Inconsistent Behavior**: Different files might have different orderings or subsets of providers
5. **Documentation Gap**: Magic strings lack context about their purpose and valid values

---

## Why This Matters

### Benefits for Developers

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All constants defined in one centralized, discoverable location
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Changes propagate automatically throughout the codebase
3. **Better IntelliSense**: IDEs can provide better autocomplete and documentation
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers don't need to remember magic strings
5. **Easier Onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand configuration options

### Benefits for the Codebase

1. **Type Safety**: Centralized constants work better with TypeScript's type system
2. **Reduced Bugs**: Eliminates typos and inconsistencies from repeated literals
3. **Better Testing**: Constants can be easily mocked or overridden in tests
4. **Improved Refactoring**: Renaming a constant updates all usages automatically
5. **Code Quality**: Follows DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles

### Business Impact

1. **Faster Feature Development**: Adding new providers or modes becomes trivial
2. **Reduced Bug Risk**: Fewer places for inconsistencies to creep in
3. **Lower Maintenance Cost**: Changes require fewer file modifications
4. **Better Code Reviews**: Reviewers can focus on logic, not magic strings

---

## Architecture Decision

### Location: `packages/contracts/src/constants/`

We've chosen to centralize all constants in the `packages/contracts` package for the following reasons:

#### Why `packages/contracts`?

1. **Already the Source of Truth**: This package defines shared types, schemas, and domain models used by both `apps/web` and `apps/server`
2. **Existing Import Pattern**: Both apps heavily import from `@bigcode/contracts`, so no new import patterns needed
3. **Type Co-location**: Constants can live alongside their related schemas for better type safety
4. **Single Dependency**: Avoids circular dependencies between apps and shared packages
5. **Architectural Consistency**: Follows the existing pattern where domain knowledge lives in contracts

#### Why Not Other Locations?

**❌ Separate constants folders per workspace** (`apps/web/src/constants`, `apps/server/src/constants`)

- Would require duplication of shared constants
- Creates sync issues between web and server
- Violates DRY principles

**❌ `packages/shared/src/constants`**

- `packages/shared` is for runtime utilities, not domain knowledge
- Would create confusion about where to find domain constants
- Breaks the existing architectural pattern

**✅ `packages/contracts/src/constants`**

- Centralized, single source of truth
- Co-located with related types and schemas
- Follows existing architectural patterns
- Easy to discover and import

### Folder Structure

## Constants Inventory

### 1. Provider Constants (`provider.constant.ts`)

**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (996+ usages across 106 files)

**Current Locations**:

- `packages/contracts/src/orchestration.ts` - ProviderKind Schema
- `apps/server/src/serverSettings.ts` - PROVIDER_ORDER
- `packages/contracts/src/model.ts` - PROVIDER_DISPLAY_NAMES
- `apps/server/src/provider/Layers/*.types.ts` - Individual provider constants

**Constants to Extract**:

````typescript
/**
 * All available provider kinds in the bigCode application.
 *
 * Providers represent different AI coding assistant backends that can be used
 * for code generation, chat, and other AI-powered features.
 *
 * Order matters for fallback logic in some contexts.
 */
export const PROVIDER_KINDS = ["codex", "claudeAgent", "copilot", "opencode"] as const;

/**
 * Provider fallback order used when the selected provider is disabled.
 *
 * When a user's selected provider is unavailable, the system will attempt
 * to use the next available provider in this order.
 */
export const PROVIDER_ORDER = ["codex", "claudeAgent", "copilot", "opencode"] as const;

3. Create `packages/contracts/src/constants/index.ts` barrel export

**Validation**:

- All files created with `.constant.ts` suffix
- Barrel export properly re-exports all constants
- No TypeScript errors in new files

---

### Phase 2: Extract and Document Constants (3-4 hours)

**For Each Constant File**:

1. **Copy constants** from source files to new constant files
2. **Add comprehensive JSDoc** with:
   - Purpose and usage explanation
   - Valid values and their meanings
   - When to use vs. when not to use
   - Examples where helpful
   - Related constants
3. **Preserve `as const` assertions** for literal type inference
4. **Export types** derived from constants where applicable
5. **Group related constants** logically

**Documentation Pattern**:

````typescript
/**
 * Brief one-line description.
 *
 * Detailed explanation of what this constant represents,
 * when it's used, and any important context.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { CONSTANT_NAME } from '@bigcode/contracts/constants';
 *
 * // Usage example
 * ```
 */
export const CONSTANT_NAME = /* value */ as const;
````

**Validation**:

- All constants have JSDoc documentation
- `as const` preserved where needed
- No circular dependencies
- TypeScript compiles without errors

---

### Phase 3: Update Imports Throughout Codebase (4-6 hours)

**Priority Order**:

1. Provider constants (106 files)
2. WebSocket methods (10 files)
3. Model constants (~50 files)
4. Runtime constants (~30 files)
5. Terminal constants (~20 files)
6. Provider runtime constants (~25 files)
7. Settings constants (~15 files)
8. Git constants (~10 files)
9. Storage constants (~5 files)
10. Branding constants (~5 files)

**For Each File**:

1. **Update imports** to use new constant paths:

   ```typescript
   // Before
   import { ProviderKind } from "@bigcode/contracts";
   const provider = "codex";

   // After
   import { ProviderKind, CODEX_PROVIDER } from "@bigcode/contracts";
   const provider = CODEX_PROVIDER;
   ```

2. **Replace inline literals** with constant references:

   ```typescript
   // Before
   const providers = ["codex", "claudeAgent", "copilot", "opencode"];

   // After
   import { PROVIDER_KINDS } from "@bigcode/contracts";
   const providers = [...PROVIDER_KINDS];
   ```

3. **Update Schema.Literals()** to reference constants:

   ```typescript
   // Before
   Schema.Literals(["codex", "claudeAgent", "copilot", "opencode"]);

   // After
   import { PROVIDER_KINDS } from "@bigcode/contracts/constants";
   Schema.Literals(PROVIDER_KINDS);
   ```

**Special Cases**:

- **Test files**: May need to import constants for mocking
- **Comments and docs**: Update references to point to constant definitions
- **String templates**: Keep as-is if they're user-facing messages
- **Regex patterns**: Keep as-is if they match against user input

**Validation After Each Batch**:

- Run `bun typecheck` to catch import errors
- Run `bun lint` to ensure code style
- Run affected tests to catch runtime issues

---

### Phase 4: Update Barrel Exports (30 minutes)

**Steps**:

1. **Update `packages/contracts/src/constants/index.ts`**:

   ```typescript
   export * from "./provider.constant";
   export * from "./model.constant";
   export * from "./websocket.constant";
   export * from "./runtime.constant";
   export * from "./terminal.constant";
   export * from "./storage.constant";
   export * from "./settings.constant";
   export * from "./branding.constant";
   export * from "./git.constant";
   export * from "./providerRuntime.constant";
   ```

2. **Update `packages/contracts/src/index.ts`**:
   ```typescript
   // Add to existing exports
   export * from "./constants";
   ```

**Validation**:

- All constants accessible via `@bigcode/contracts`
- No duplicate exports
- Tree-shaking works correctly

---

### Phase 5: Validation and Testing (1 hour)

**Comprehensive Validation**:

1. **Type Checking**: `bun typecheck`
   - Zero TypeScript errors
   - All imports resolve correctly
   - Types infer correctly from constants

2. **Linting**: `bun lint`
   - Zero linting errors
   - Code style consistent

3. **Formatting**: `bun fmt`
   - All files formatted correctly

4. **Testing**: `bun run test`
   - All tests pass
   - No runtime errors
   - Mock data uses constants correctly

5. **Manual Verification**:
   - Search for remaining inline literals: `grep -r '"codex"' apps/ packages/`
   - Check Schema.Literals() usage
   - Verify no circular dependencies

**Validation Checklist**:

- [ ] `bun typecheck` passes with zero errors
- [ ] `bun lint` passes with zero errors
- [ ] `bun fmt` completes successfully
- [ ] `bun run test` passes all tests
- [ ] No inline provider string literals remain
- [ ] All Schema.Literals() reference constants
- [ ] Barrel exports work correctly
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive

---

### Phase 6: Documentation Updates (30 minutes)

**Update Documentation**:

1. **AGENTS.md**: Add section about constants organization
2. **Architecture docs**: Document the constants structure
3. **Contributing guide**: Explain how to add new constants
4. **This document**: Mark as "Completed" when done

**Example Addition to AGENTS.md**:

````markdown
## Constants Organization

All application constants are centralized in `packages/contracts/src/constants/`.

### Adding New Constants

1. Determine which constant file it belongs in (or create a new one)
2. Add the constant with comprehensive JSDoc documentation
3. Export from the constant file
4. Use the constant instead of inline literals throughout the codebase

### Importing Constants

```typescript
// Import from the main contracts package
import { CODEX_PROVIDER, DEFAULT_MODEL } from "@bigcode/contracts";

// Or import from specific constant files
import { CODEX_PROVIDER } from "@bigcode/contracts/constants/provider.constant";
```
````

### Guidelines

- Never use inline string literals for provider names, modes, or states
- Always import constants from `@bigcode/contracts`
- Document new constants with JSDoc
- Use `as const` for literal type inference

````

## Migration Guide

### For Developers

#### Before This Refactoring

```typescript
// Inline literals scattered everywhere
const provider = "codex";
const providers = ["codex", "claudeAgent", "copilot", "opencode"];

if (provider === "codex") {
  // Codex-specific logic
}

// Schema with inline literals
export const ProviderKind = Schema.Literals(["codex", "claudeAgent", "copilot", "opencode"]);
````

#### After This Refactoring

```typescript
import { CODEX_PROVIDER, PROVIDER_KINDS } from "@bigcode/contracts";

const provider = CODEX_PROVIDER;
const providers = [...PROVIDER_KINDS];

if (provider === CODEX_PROVIDER) {
  // Codex-specific logic
}

// Schema referencing constants
export const ProviderKind = Schema.Literals(PROVIDER_KINDS);
```

### Common Migration Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Replace Inline Literals

```typescript
// Before
const PROVIDER_KEYS = ["codex", "claudeAgent", "copilot", "opencode"] as const;

// After
import { PROVIDER_KINDS } from "@bigcode/contracts";
const PROVIDER_KEYS = PROVIDER_KINDS;
```

#### Pattern 2: Update Schema Definitions

```typescript
// Before
export const ProviderKind = Schema.Literals(["codex", "claudeAgent", "copilot", "opencode"]);

// After
import { PROVIDER_KINDS } from "@bigcode/contracts/constants";
export const ProviderKind = Schema.Literals(PROVIDER_KINDS);
```

#### Pattern 3: Replace String Comparisons

```typescript
// Before
if (provider === "codex") {
  // ...
}

// After
import { CODEX_PROVIDER } from "@bigcode/contracts";
if (provider === CODEX_PROVIDER) {
  // ...
}
```

#### Pattern 4: Update Object Keys

```typescript
// Before
const config = {
  codex: {
    /* ... */
  },
  claudeAgent: {
    /* ... */
  },
  copilot: {
    /* ... */
  },
  opencode: {
    /* ... */
  },
};

// After
import {
  CODEX_PROVIDER,
  CLAUDE_PROVIDER,
  COPILOT_PROVIDER,
  OPENCODE_PROVIDER,
} from "@bigcode/contracts";
const config = {
  [CODEX_PROVIDER]: {
    /* ... */
  },
  [CLAUDE_PROVIDER]: {
    /* ... */
  },
  [COPILOT_PROVIDER]: {
    /* ... */
  },
  [OPENCODE_PROVIDER]: {
    /* ... */
  },
};
```

#### Pattern 5: Update Default Values

```typescript
// Before
const DEFAULT_PROVIDER = "codex";

// After
import { DEFAULT_PROVIDER_KIND } from "@bigcode/contracts";
const DEFAULT_PROVIDER = DEFAULT_PROVIDER_KIND;
```

## FAQ

### Q: Why centralize constants instead of keeping them with their domain logic?

**A**: While co-location has benefits, the massive duplication (996+ occurrences of provider strings) creates a maintenance nightmare. Centralization provides:

- Single source of truth
- Easier refactoring
- Better discoverability
- Reduced bugs from typos

### Q: Won't this create a "god file" anti-pattern?

**A**: No, because we're organizing constants into 10 focused files by domain (provider, model, websocket, etc.). Each file has a clear purpose and related constants are grouped together.

### Q: What about performance? Won't importing constants everywhere slow things down?

**A**: Modern bundlers (Vite, esbuild) use tree-shaking to eliminate unused exports. Importing constants has negligible performance impact and may actually improve performance by enabling better code splitting.

### Q: Should I use constants in test files?

**A**: Yes! Using constants in tests makes them more maintainable. If a provider name changes, tests update automatically. However, you may want to create test-specific constants for mock data.

### Q: What if I need a constant that's not in the constants folder?

**A**: Add it! Follow the documentation pattern, choose the appropriate constant file (or create a new one), and submit a PR. The constants folder is meant to grow with the application.

### Q: Can I still use inline strings for user-facing messages?

**A**: Yes. This refactoring targets configuration constants, not user-facing text. String templates, error messages, and UI text can remain inline or in i18n files.

### Q: What about constants that are only used in one file?

**A**: If a constant is truly file-specific and unlikely to be reused, it can stay in that file. This refactoring targets **repeated** constants used across multiple files.

### Q: How do I handle constants that depend on environment variables?

**A**: Constants can reference `import.meta.env` or `process.env`. See `branding.constant.ts` for an example with `APP_STAGE_LABEL`.

### Q: Will this break existing code?

**A**: No. We're adding new constant exports while maintaining backward compatibility. Existing imports continue to work. We'll update them incrementally.

### Q: What's the rollback plan if something goes wrong?

**A**: Git revert to the previous commit. Since this is a pure refactoring with no logic changes, rollback is straightforward.

## Conclusion

This constants refactoring initiative addresses a critical technical debt in the bigCode codebase. By centralizing 1,500+ repeated string literals into a well-organized constants folder, we'll improve maintainability, reduce bugs, and provide a better developer experience.

The refactoring is designed to be incremental, testable, and reversible. Each phase has clear validation criteria, and the entire process is estimated to take 9-12 hours of focused work.

Upon completion, adding new providers, modes, or configuration options will be trivial, and the codebase will be more resilient to typos and inconsistencies.
